# About the Project
The project aims to teach and practice Morse Code. If you have ever used war movies or satellite feeds you might here some dihs and dahs. That's morse code. Consider this a new langauge or challenge to learn such that you can communicate with your peers with just some beeps.

## Demo
TODO and will be uploaded through GitHub

# Tech Stack Used
1. ReactJS
2. React-Icons for icons mostly lucide icons,
3. For colors referred to Coolors.
4. For sliders used `react-range` package.
5. Vitest for creating test cases for some of the functions.

## What I am proud of?
1. The sidebar you are seeing is completely dynamic and a component that can be passed a JSON to change the content. The JSON can be found on `/src/config.sidebar.jsx`
2. Learning Morse code and the Modern UI I discovered.

## Issue
1. [Why I had to create branch origin/spy?](https://github.com/ki8yk8/morse/issues/1)
